      <HEAD>&#xA7; 1271.1 What are the purpose and scope of this part?</HEAD>
    <P>(a) <I>Purpose.</I>
   The purpose of this part, in conjunction with &#xA7;&#xA7; 207.9(a)(5), 210.1(c), 210.2, 807.20(d), and 820.1(a) of this chapter, is to create an electronic registration and listing system for establishments that manufacture human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/P's) and to establish donor-eligibility, current good tissue practice, and other procedures to prevent the introduction, transmission, and spread of communicable diseases by HCT/P's.</P>
<P>(b) <I>Scope.</I>
   (1) If you are an establishment that manufactures HCT/P's that are regulated solely under the authority of section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (the PHS Act), this part requires you to register and list your HCT/P's with the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research and to comply with the other requirements contained in this part, whether or not the HCT/P enters into interstate commerce. Those HCT/P's that are regulated solely under the authority of section 361 of the PHS Act are described in &#xA7; 1271.10.</P>
  <P>(2) If you are an establishment that manufactures HCT/P's that are regulated as drugs, devices and/or biological products under section 351 of the PHS Act and/or the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, &#xA7;&#xA7; 207.9(a)(5) and 807.20(d) of this chapter require you to register and list your HCT/P's following the procedures in part 207 (if a drug and/or biological product) of this chapter or part 807 (if a device) of this chapter. Sections 210.1(c), 210.2, 211.1(b), and 820.1(a) of this chapter require you to comply with the donor-eligibility procedures in subpart C of this part and the current good tissue practice procedures in subpart D of this part, in addition to all other applicable regulations.</P>

You must follow CGTP requirements to prevent the introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable diseases by HCT/Ps (e.g., by ensuring that the HCT/Ps do not contain communicable disease agents, that they are not contaminated, and that they do not become contaminated during manufacturing). Communicable diseases include, but are not limited to, those transmitted by viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites, and transmissible spongiform encephalopathy agents. CGTP requirements govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of HCT/Ps, including but not limited to all steps in recovery, donor screening, donor testing, processing, storage, labeling, packaging, and distribution. The CGTP provisions specifically governing determinations of donor eligibility, including donor screening and testing, are set out separately in subpart C of this part.</P>

Under this system, records pertaining to a particular HCT/P must be maintained in such a way as to facilitate review of the HCT/Ps history before making it available for distribution and, if necessary, subsequent to the HCT/Ps release as part of a followup evaluation or investigation. Records pertinent to the manufacture of HCT/Ps (e.g., labeling and packaging procedures, and equipment logs) must also be maintained and organized under the records management system. If records are maintained in more than one location, then the records management system must be designed to ensure prompt identification, location, and retrieval of all records.</P>

You must retain records for archived specimens of dura mater for 10 years after the appropriate disposition of the specimens.</P>

As soon as practical, you must review, evaluate, and investigate each complaint that represents an event required to be reported to FDA, as described in &#xA7; 1271.350. You must review and evaluate a complaint relating to core CGTP requirements that does not represent an event required to be reported to determine whether an investigation is necessary; an investigation may include referring a copy of the complaint to another establishment that performed manufacturing steps pertinent to the complaint. When no investigation is made, you must maintain a record that includes the reason no investigation was made, and the name of the individual(s) responsible for the decision not to investigate.</P>

To request a hearing, the recipient of the written order or prior possessor of such HCT/P must make the request within 5 working days of receipt of a written order for retention, recall, destruction, and/or cessation (or within 5 working days of the agency's possession of an HCT/P under paragraph (a)(2) of this section), in accordance with part 16 of this chapter. An order of destruction will be held in abeyance pending resolution of the hearing request. Upon request under part 16 of this chapter, FDA will provide an opportunity for an expedited hearing for an order of cessation that is not stayed by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs.</P>
